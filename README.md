#   Malloc
Concealed within his fortress, the lord of Mordor sees all. His gaze pierces memory, processor, kernel, and disk space. You know of what I speak, Gandalf: a great memory usage, eating the proccess, wreathed in flame.

#   How it works
Malloc is a library/function that allocates dynamically the memory from the heap, which is an area where something is stored.

It allocates the memory of a requested size and returns a pointer to the start of the allocated block and stores this pointer in a variable of the same type of the initial malloc state.

 It is useful when you dont know the amount of memory that your program gonna need, so you can dynamically alocate it in a smarter way, also, it allows objects to live beyound the scope of the current block.

#   What it can do
* still learning and implementing.
